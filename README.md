# 3D Models Timestamps Archive

This repository is a flat-file archive of original 3D models I create, each documented and timestamped to prove authorship. Every entry includes:

- A **preview image** (`.jpg`) showing:
  - Front and back renders of the 3D model
  - Its unique UV layout outline
  - Creation date and timestamp printed on the image
- A corresponding **OpenTimestamps proof** (`.ots` file), cryptographically anchoring the image to a blockchain-verified timestamp.

### How to verify the timestamp

To verify the creation date of a model:

1. Download the preview image (`.jpg`) and the corresponding OpenTimestamps proof file (`.ots`).
2. Visit the official OpenTimestamps client or use their online verifier at [https://opentimestamps.org/](https://opentimestamps.org/).
3. Use the `.ots` file together with the `.jpg` image to verify the cryptographic timestamp anchored to the blockchain.
4. This process confirms that the model existed on or before the timestamp date shown on the image.
